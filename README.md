# Mathematics Artworks

This repository is currently (for the most part) vacant.

The expectation is that the author will soon:

* Port over and document his TSP artworks.
* Port over and document his other linear optimization artworks.
* Create graph artwork using real data.

Once these tasks are met, the author will likely use this README as the place to have rendered the artworks.
